# Bellabeat Case Study: Data Analysis Project

---

## Project Overview: 
Welcome to the Bellabeat case study project, where I explore how the wellness technology company Bellabeat can leverage data insights to improve its marketing strategy. In this project, I analyze fitness device data, draw insights about consumer behavior, and offer strategic recommendations to support Bellabeat’s growth in the wellness and smart device market.

This project includes a comprehensive set of deliverables:

**1. Documentation Report:** Overview of the entire data analysis process, from defining business goals to generating actionable insights.
**2. R Notebook:** Code chunks detailing the steps for data processing and analysis.
**3. Visualizations:** Graphs and charts that illustrate key findings and trends.
**4. Presentation Slides:** Summary of the project findings and recommendations.
**5. Video Presentation:** A walkthrough of the project, including methods, results, and implications.

## Case Study Background

### Bellabeat is a high-tech company that manufactures wellness-focused smart devices for women. This study is part of Bellabeat's initiative to understand user habits and preferences through data analysis, thereby informing marketing strategies and fostering user engagement. Using a dataset from the Fitbit fitness tracker (available via Kaggle), the analysis examines daily activity, sleep, heart rate, and hydration patterns, with the following objectives:

1. Identify patterns in smart device usage.
2. Draw parallels between Fitbit user trends and potential Bellabeat users.
3. Generate actionable recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.

## Data Analysis Process

### The project follows a structured data analysis process with six key steps:

1. Ask
  * Defining the business task and identifying key stakeholders to ensure the analysis is aligned with Bellabeat’s goals.
2. Prepare
  * Reviewing and preparing the Fitbit dataset, assessing data quality, and addressing potential biases.
3. Process
  * Cleaning the dataset, addressing errors, and formatting data for analysis.
4. Analyze
  * Aggregating data, performing calculations, and identifying trends to gain insights into user behavior.
5. Share
  * Creating visualizations and compiling findings into a report and presentation to communicate insights effectively.
6. Act
  * Offering high-level recommendations on Bellabeat’s marketing strategy based on insights gained from the analysis.
